Customization Files that I use for Cadsoft Eagle
Based on a live video that I did on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFXY_0zIaOw

These are the files that I use with Cadsoft Eagle 7.5.

They include the eagle.scr file that creates menu's etc, blank buttons to make your own menu button and a few of my favourite scripts and ulp's.

Most of these Files can live in the SCR/ULP directories that you set up in your Eagle directories settings.

However, eagle.scr needs to live in your eagle/scr directory. it's best to backup your old eagle.scr

Any image that you use for the icon needs to live in the eagle/bin folder.
